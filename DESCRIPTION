Description: We describe a new R package entitled 'saeMSPE' for the well-known Fay Herriot model and nested error regression model in small area estimation. Based on this package, it is possible to easily compute various common mean squared predictive error (MSPE) estimators, as well as several existing variance component predictors as a byproduct, for these two models.
